                        <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> This is context specific and has two definitions
                        <ul>
                            <li>The state of play in which neither players are attacking, blocking an attack, or jumping (both characters are free to act in any way).</li>
                            <li>The singular form which is the player state where they are free to act eg. they finished their recovery frames so returned to neutral.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Hitbox:</strong> The zone(s) that checks for overlap with a hurtbox. If overlap occurs, the opponent is considered hit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hurtbox:</strong> The zone(s) that check for overlap with a hitbox. If your hurtbox overlaps with the opponent's hitbox, you are considered hit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> This refers to the state where a player has initiated an attack against the opponent. The interaction ends when the players return to neutral.</li>
                        <li><strong>Turn:</strong> While it may be unintuitive at first, fighting games are turn based. During an interaction, whoever has the frame advantage (can act first), has the turn.</li>
                        <li><strong>Command Normal:</strong> Attacks that are executed by a direction and a button. While crouching normals fit this definition, they are referred to as "crouching normals."</li>
                        <li><strong>Air Invincibility:</strong> A special type of hurtbox that only checks for grounded attacks. Very important for anti airing.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Footsies:</strong> An expansion on neutral where both players are trying to manage their spacing and expose a weakness in the opponent's defense, typically with a low normal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mental Stack:</strong> The number of strategies the player can focus on at one time. Focusing on a potential strategy the opponent may execute enables the player to react to it significantly easier.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conditioning:</strong> Repeating a strategy so the opponent starts to assume the strategy will be used at the next opportunity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mixup:</strong> A situation where the offensive player has multiple attack options which require different defensive actions.</li>
                        <li><strong>50/50:</strong> A common type of mixup which presents 2 offensive options that require commitment to defend against. An example of a 50/50 would be strike (block) or a command throw (jump).</li>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Pure Defensive Play (PDP)</h3>
                <p>Don't pay attention to health bars. The points don't matter. Don't allow your decisions to be affected by the health bars.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the opponent is grounded, only attack if you are guaranteed a punish counter. If "Punish Counter" doesn't appear, you attacked too late. If "Counter" appears, you were still too late and the opponent tried to start an attack</li>
                    <li>Punish using a normal.
                    <li>When the opponent jumps into your space, counter with an anti air. If you get hit, you need to start your attack earlier</li>
                    <li>Throw when the opponent is in range. If you are in the corner, backthrow to get out of the corner. This eliminates the concerns of getting hit by a DI wallsplat.</li>
                    <li>DI is exclusively a counter measure. Never use it offensively or on prediction.</li>
                    <li>You should only move your character with the intention of getting in the correct range to anti air a jump in.</li>
                    <li>Block low unless they jump or if you recognize an overhead attack.</li>
                    <li>Besides DP, all specials and supers will only be used mid combo.</li>
                    <li>Never jump.</li>
                    <li>If the opponent gains a life lead and goes full screen for the timeout, let them. Use the time to practice specials/supers. Remember: you are there for your own development, not the rank points. The points don't matter.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While PDP will often lead to dull stalemate scenarios, the purpose is not to win. It's to build knowledge of the game's characters so you can identify punish windows, deploy the correct defensive options, and to learn how to recognize player patterns. In any well made fighting games, every action has an intended counter. If you can work out what your options are for most scenarios, your defense will be unbreakable.
<br>The secondary purpose of PDP is to act as an introduction to neutral and footsies via your anti air spacing.</p>
                <p>Your punish counters should be a normal rather than a throw. The first gameplan modifier will make use of this rule.</p>
                <p>PDP has no way to counter zoners or grapplers.</p>
                <p>PDP is entirely about observation and reaction. While you will naturally start to see patterns and begin predicting the opponent's moves, acting on prediction is not a part of the gameplan.
Only react.</p>
                <p>When you feel comfortable with all the elements of this plan, pick a modifier to introduce to your gameplan. Only choose 1 at a time so you can focus on integrating the modifier fully.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="modifiers">
            <button class="collapsible">Modifiers to Game Plan</button>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Use combos for punish counter extensions. Start with cancelling your punish counter normal into a fireball. As you get more comfortable, increase the complexity. This should be your first modifier.</li>
                    <li>Replace 2HP with DP for anti airing. While the input is more difficult, the introduction of total aerial invincibility means you actually have more time to execute and will significantly reduce the chance of getting counter hit while also increasing your damage output. A significant upgrade. This should be your second modifier.</li>
                    <li>Delay tech. Learn how to block while doing a delayed throw tech to cover a 50/50 mixup. This can be achieved in a single training session. Once you know, you know</li>
                    <li>Parrying when the opponent does a fireball, slow special, a DI, or a super. Parry is to be used as a reaction block, not a pre-emptive one.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <p>Parry has the same block stun as if you did a regular block. The benefits are not losing drive guage (you actually build drive guage when parrying hits) and a chance at getting a perfect parry. When you perfect parry, you reset to neutral immediately but any damage you do as a punish counter starts with a 50% penalty.</p>
                        <p>The main reason it's so important to only parry on reaction is because if you get thrown, you take +70% damage when compared to a normal throw. This happens because throwing a parry gets treated as a punish counter.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Drive Rush Counter. When the opponent tries to drive rush, use a light normal to hit them first.</li>
                    <li>Whiff punish. When you can consistently stay just outside of the opponent's strike range, react to their button with a button of your own to punish.</li>
                    <!--<li>Use of a fast normal when the opponent tries to walk into your space (normally 2MK).</li>-->
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Drive System Counters</strong></li>
                <li>Parry: Throwing is your best answer. It's considered a punish counter so you will get more damage from a throw if you bait a parry first.</li>
                <li>Rush: Players often abuse this to attempt skipping neutral. Simply use a light normal to stop them.</li>
                <li>Impact: This requires the most situational awareness to respond to. If you are cornered, you are at risk of wall splat. If you are cornered and burned out, you are at risk of getting stunned. Your options are:
<ul>
<li>Counter Drive Impact. Make sure you have enough health to absorb the initial hit</li>
<li>Parry. Unlike regular blocking, you won't get wall splat if you parry. you also have a chance to perfect parry to steal the turn</li>
<li>Throw</li>
<li>Armour Break either manually by doing a fast 3 hit combo, or by using an armour breaking move such as a super</li>
</ul>
</li>
                <p>When you are able to use this game plan to consistently win the interactions it's intended for, while also applying the modifiers, a new game plan (with a more offensive focus) will be introduced.</p>
