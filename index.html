            <p> Welcome!<br><br>The flow of this guide has been designed with your progression in mind so you shouldn't
                need
                to skip ahead. In theory, as long as you are taking the time to implement each element as they are
                introduced, the next one that is presented to you should be the most relevant to your current needs. Of
                course, skip ahead if you want to see what's coming, but I wouldn't recommend skipping implementation
                steps.<br>While this will take genuine work, I believe this structure will give you a massive head start
                and
                will prepare you to experience what fighting games have to offer much sooner.</p>
            <p>While this guide is fairly comprehensive as an introduction, you will find yourself in a cycle of rapid
                improvement followed by sudden plateus. This is a good thing. It just means you need to add another tool
                to
                your toolkit to see that improvement again. The idea that you can finish learning a fighting game is
                madness. There is always knowledge to strive for.<br><br>Good luck, have fun!</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Pure Defensive Play (PDP)</h3>
                <p>While PDP will often lead to dull stalemate scenarios, the purpose is not to win. It's to build
                    knowledge of the game's characters so you can identify punish windows, deploy the correct defensive
                    options, and to learn how to recognize player patterns. In any well made fighting games, every
                    action has an intended counter. If you can work out what your options are for most scenarios, your
                    defense will be unbreakable.
                    <br>The secondary purpose of PDP is to act as an introduction to neutral and footsies via your anti
                    air spacing.
                </p>
                <p>PDP is entirely about observation and reaction. While you will naturally start to see patterns and
                    begin predicting the opponent's moves, acting on prediction is not a part of the gameplan.
                    Only react.</p>
                <p>Don't pay attention to health bars. The points don't matter. Don't allow your decisions to be
                    affected by the health bars.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never jump.</li>
                    <li>Block low unless they jump or if you recognize an overhead attack.</li>
                    <li>You should only move your character with the intention of getting in the correct range to anti
                        air a jump in.</li>
                    <li>Punish using a normal.
                    <li>While the opponent is grounded, only attack if you are guaranteed a punish counter. If "Punish
                        Counter" doesn't appear, you attacked too late. If "Counter" appears, you were still too late
                        and the opponent tried to start an attack</li>
                    <li>When the opponent jumps into your space, counter with an anti air. If you get hit, you need to
                        start your attack earlier</li>
                    <li>Throw when the opponent is in range. If you are in the corner, backthrow to get out of the
                        corner. This eliminates the concerns of getting hit by a DI wallsplat.</li>
                    <li>DI is exclusively a counter measure. Never use it offensively or on prediction.</li>
                    <li>Besides DP, all specials and supers will only be used mid combo.</li>
                    <li>If the opponent gains a life lead and goes full screen for the timeout, let them. Use the time
                        to practice specials/supers. Remember: you are there for your own development, not the rank
                        points. The points don't matter.<br>With this mentality, you will actually climb the ranks
                        faster as you will improve enough to keep the points you earn.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your punish counters should be a normal rather than a throw. The first gameplan modifier will make
                    use of this rule.</p>
                <p>At first you will find you can only punish big, high commitment specials/supers. As your knowledge of
                    the character's movesets increases, you will start to identify when their blocked normals are
                    punishable. The first examples of this you should observe are sweeps. Finding these opportunities is
                    key to learning character matchups.</p>
                <p>PDP has no way to counter grapplers. This is because grapplers require prediction to beat. As
                    prediction is banned...grapplers will beat you!</p>
                <p>When you feel comfortable with all the elements of this plan, pick a modifier to introduce to your
                    gameplan. Only choose 1 at a time so you can focus on integrating the modifier fully.</p>

                        <p>From the start, you were told to use 2HP to anti air. This isn't a bad option as it's a very
                            simple
                            input that provides a small amount of air invincibility and a suitably placed hitbox with
                            decent
                            damage.</p>

                        <p>You have a better option.</p>
                        <p>Light DP instantly provides total air invincibility from frame 1. The startup is nearly
                            halved, the
                            hitbox is larger and more consistently placed throughout the move while also staying active
                            for a
                            bit longer, and the damage is increased.</p>
                        <img src="akuma-lp-shoryuken.gif" style="width:200px" loading="lazy">
                        <p>This is a significant upgrade. While it is more difficult to perform, with practise the
                            difference
                            will be negligible. Because it's air invincible from frame 1, it actually gives you more
                            time to
                            execute while eliminating concerns of getting counter hit.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Use parry when the opponent does a fireball, slow special, a DI, or a super. Parry is to be
                            used as a
                            reaction block, not a pre-emptive one. This should be your third modifier.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <p>Parry has the same block stun as if you did a regular block. The benefits are not losing
                                drive
                                guage (you actually build drive guage when parrying hits), no wallsplat if you absorb a
                                DI, and
                                a chance at getting a perfect parry. When you perfect parry (it's a 2 frame window, so
                                very
                                difficult to do deliberately), you reset to neutral immediately but any damage you do as
                                a
                                punish counter starts with a 50% penalty. A reasonable trade off for stealing a turn.
                            </p>
                            <p>The main reason it's so important to only parry on reaction is because if you get thrown
                                while in
                                the parry state, you take +70% damage when compared to a normal throw. This happens
                                because
                                throwing a parry gets treated as a punish counter. The recovery frames for a parry that
                                isn't in
                                blockstun add up to just over half a second. In Street Fighter, half a second feels like
                                forever.</p>

                        <p>Any cancellable normals can make use of a DRC to extend combos at the cost of 3 bars. You
                            have two
                            choices of inputs for a DRC, dash or MP+MK. For now Drive Rush is only to be used for combo

                        <p>The move you DRC into gains additional frame advantage (the opponent will be in Hitstun for
                            longer)
                            which opens up new combo routes</p>

<p>Long Drive Rush combos can highlight how aggressive the damage scaling can be. It's impossible to give a succinct guide on damage scaling, so you will need to explore this in training mode or read move descriptions in <a href="https://fullmeter.com/fatonline/" target="_blank">FAT</a> to discover the scaling implications of every action.
<br>Though it's worth pointing out that it's often optimal to use supers at the end of combos as their scaling floor is much higher than other moves (lvl1 30%, lvl2 40%, lvl3 50%) as it means even if you do a really long combo that brings the damage of each subsequent hit down to sub 30%, finishing with a super can still deal significant damage.</p>

<p>Developing a decent fireball game is vital. You will need to spend time learning exactly how your character's fireball options work. Primarily you will need to know, per button, how fast they are and how many hits they have</p>
<p>Challenging an opponents fireball game is a very fast session of rock paper scissors where you need to be mindful of their options as well as yours.</p>
<p>The main things to consider:</p>
<li>Do they have the drive meter to do an OD fireball? If you throw out a regular fireball, the opponent's OD fireball will win and hit you.</li>
<li>Are they in jump in range? If you throw out a fireball and they jump, they might hit you before you recover.</li>
<li>Does the opponent's character have projectile invincible moves? This could be used to bypass your fireball and hit you. If they have a super ready, it has the potential to be devastating. You will often see Cammy's using this option to hit you with their lvl3.</li>

<p>Avoid mindlessly throwing fireballs. It should be an informed choice.</p>

                        <li>Parry: Throwing is your best answer. It's considered a punish counter so you will get more
                            damage
                            from a throw if you bait a parry first.</li>
                        <li>Rush: Players often abuse this to attempt skipping neutral. Simply use a light normal to
                            stop them.
                        </li>
                        <li>Impact: This requires the most situational awareness to respond to. If you are cornered, you
                            are at
                            risk of wall splat. If you are cornered and burned out, you are at risk of getting stunned.
                            Your
                            options are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Counter Drive Impact. Make sure you have enough health to absorb the initial hit

                                <li>Parry. Unlike regular blocking, you won't get wall splat if you parry. you also have
                                    a
                                    chance to perfect parry to steal the turn</li>

                                <li>Armour Break either manually by doing a fast 3 hit combo, or by using an armour
                                    breaking
                                    move such as a super</li>

<li>Watch your replays. There is no better way to work out where you can improve than by watching your gameplay without the responsibility of execution. Make notes on the good and the bad so you can build an understanding of your habits.
<br>Play along with the replay in your mind. See if there's anything you would do differently.</li>
                        <li>Learn the rest of your main character's moves. This will be the most time intensive task,
                            but slowly building a full understanding of your character's toolkit will open up punish and
                            combo opportunities. Integrating the moves one at a time will enable you to understand the
                            intended use case for each move.</li>
                        <li>Drive Rush Counter. When the opponent tries to drive rush, use a light normal to hit them
                            first.
                        </li>
<li>Prediction. As your knowledge and reaction times improve, you will find yourself in situations where you are 100% confident you know what the opponents next move will be. Make note of when these moments occur, and how often you were right. When your predictions consistently come true, ease up on the no prediction rule. Strike first! (though prediction DI will always be a bad idea. Anything but predictive DI)</li>
                        <li>Advanced spacing. When you start to understand the character's maximum strike range, adjust
                            the movement rule in the gameplan so you are always JUST outside of your opponent's strike
                            range.</li>
                        <li>Whiff punish. When you can consistently stay just outside of the opponent's strike range,
                            react to their button with a button of your own to punish.</li>
                        <li>Use of a fast normal when the opponent tries to walk into your space (normally a crouching
                            medium
                            attack). As this is a shift towards offensive play, this should be the final modifier.</li>

<p>When you are able to use this gameplan to consistently win the interactions it's intended for, while also applying the modifiers, you will find you already have the understanding you need to go on the offensive. At this stage, you can start to relax the rules of this gameplan and start to create your own. This is where fighting games really begin!</p>

                        <p>HA! Got you! This is the frame data section!</p>
                        <p>Knowledge of data serves two main
                            purposes</p>
                        <li>Punish Counters. If an opponent's move whiffs, you can see how long you have to get in with
                            an
                            attack. Or if you block an attack, you can know if you get out of Blockstun before they
                            finish their
                            recovery, providing a window to start your turn.</li>
                        <li>Combos. Having a database of the startup, cancel types (can it cancel into a special?
                            super?), and
                            Hitstun for all moves trivialises building combos.<br>Choosing a move to initiate an attack
                            can be
                            greatly informed by the combo routes you learn to maximise your damage output. Optimising
                            for the
                            most common scenarios means you will need to win fewer interactions to win a round.</li>
                        <p>If you want to improve your knowledge fast, the best way is to utilise frame data tools. The
                            barrier
                            to entry is so much lower than it may seem.</p>
                        <p>Keeping a log of moves you struggled to deal with can prove invaluable. Pairing this log with
                            a frame
                            data tool such as <a href="https://ultimateframedata.com/sf6/" target="_blank">Ultimate
                                Frame
                                Data</a>, which has a gif of each move, along with visualised hitboxes and frame data,
                            to help
                            you identify a way to counter a particular move which eliminates the much slower trial and
                            error
                            phase.</p>
                        <p>Frame data may seem needlessly nerdy rabbit hole, but if used correctly, your time spent
                            accessing
                            frame data tools is very brief. You have a specific question you want answered, go in, get
                            the
                            answer, get out. The upfront intimidation from all the information will fall away when you
                            realise
                            how much faster it makes learning character matchups and your own character.</p>
                        <p>Trying to store all of the data in your head is a waste of time. Use frame data tools to
                            answer
                            specific questions as they arise, and over time you will build an intuitive understanding of
                            all
                            character's strengths and weaknesses</p>

                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Hitbox:</strong> The zone(s) that checks for overlap with a hurtbox. If overlap occurs,

                    <li><strong>Hurtbox:</strong> The zone(s) that check for overlap with a hitbox. If your hurtbox
                        overlaps with the opponent's hitbox, you are considered hit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> This refers to the state where a player has initiated an attack
                        against the opponent. The interaction ends when the players return to neutral.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn:</strong> While it may be unintuitive at first, fighting games are turn based.
                        During an interaction, whoever has the frame advantage (can act first), has the turn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Command Normal:</strong> Attacks that are executed by a direction and a button. While
                        crouching normals fit this definition, they are referred to as "crouching normals".</li>
                    <li><strong>Hitstun:</strong> The number of frames after a player is hit by an attack before they

                    <li><strong>Cancel:</strong> When a second move is executed during the active frames of a
                        cancellable move, the player immediately goes into the startup for the second move, cancelling
                        the remaining active and recovery frames of the first move.</li>
                    <li><strong>Link:</strong> Describes a type of combo that allows the first attack to recover
                        completely, then get to the active frames of the second attack before the opponents hitstun is
                        over.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Invincibility:</strong> A type of hurtbox that ignores aerial attacks. Very
                        important for anti airing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Projectile Invinciblility:</strong> A type of hurtbox that ignores projectiles. Key
                        component in anti-zoning strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Super Art (SA):</strong> A special move that requires at least 1 full bar of super meter. Each character has 3 supers that require different inputs to execute.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Art (CA):</strong> The revenge mechanic of Street Fighter 6. A Critical Art is an enhanced version of level 3 supers that is unlocked when the player is at 25% health or less. level 1 and 2 are unaffected.</li>
<li><strong>OverDrive (OD):</strong> An enhanced version of a character's special moves with different traits (often, OD DP's are completely invincible, fireballs have extra hits etc). They cost 2 bars of drive guage to execute.</li>
                    <li><strong>Whiff:</strong> When an attack doesn't make contact with the opponent. Having to wait
                        for the entire animation to play out, without the opponent being in blockstun, leaves you open
                        for a whiff punish</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaty:</strong> A type of knockdown setup where a player times their attack so the
                        active frames occur on the first frame the opponent is able to act after a knockdown, forcing
                        the opponent to immediately deal with the attack.</li>

                            their spacing and expose a weakness in the opponent's defense, typically with a low normal.
                        </li>
